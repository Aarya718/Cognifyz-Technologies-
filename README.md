# TASK 1 - Restaurant Recommendation System

This project builds a content-based restaurant recommendation system that suggests restaurants based on user preferences for cuisine type and price range.

Here’s a concise summary of the restaurant recommendation system:

This project builds a **content-based restaurant recommendation system** using **cuisine preference and price range**.  

- **Step 1: Load Dataset** – Reads restaurant data from a CSV file.  
- **Step 2: Data Cleaning** – Drops irrelevant columns, handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and normalizes numerical data.  
- **Step 3: Data Visualization** – Generates **five** key plots: rating distribution, restaurant count by price range, cost boxplot, votes vs. rating scatterplot, and correlation heatmap.  
- **Step 4: Feature Engineering** – Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** on cuisine types.  
- **Step 5: Compute Similarity Matrix** – Calculates **cosine similarity** between restaurants based on cuisine.  
- **Step 6: Recommendation System** – Matches user inputs (cuisine, price range) to find and rank similar restaurants.  
- **Step 7: Testing** – Provides sample recommendations for a given cuisine and price range.
